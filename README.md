## Usage

Flat Animated Weather SVG Icon Kit is a collection of carefully crafted SVG files. 
You can use these SVG files in many ways for your websites/projects/works.

For example:
In your website:

1. Download the svg folder, and upload to your server.

2. Then link it in your website same as other iframe elements!
!note: since these are animated svg files, please use "<iframe>" tag to avoid animation problems.

```
<iframe class="frame"
  src="images/svg/b_1_partly_cloudy.svg">
</iframe>
```
